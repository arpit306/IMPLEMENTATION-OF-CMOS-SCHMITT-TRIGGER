# Implementation-of-CMOS-Schmitt-Trigger
This repository presents the design of Schmitt Trigger implemented using Synopsys Custom Compiler tool on 28nm CMOS Technology.
# Abstract
This repository presents the Analog IC design and Implementation of a CMOS Schmitt Trigger Circuit. This Implementation is done on Sysnopsys Custom Compiler Tool and libraries available on Cloud platform using 28nm Technology. The Schmitt Trigger is a comparator circuit that incorporates positive feedback, are extensively used in digital as well as analog systems to filter out any noise present in a signal line and produce a clean digital signal. The working of design is verified using Circuit Schematic and Waveforms.
