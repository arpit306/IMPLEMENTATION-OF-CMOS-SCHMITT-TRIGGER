# Implementation-of-CMOS-Schmitt-Trigger
This repository presents the design of Schmitt Trigger implemented using Synopsys Custom Compiler tool on 28nm CMOS Technology.
# Abstract
This repository presents the Analog IC design and Implementation of a CMOS Schmitt Trigger Circuit. This Implementation is done on Sysnopsys Custom Compiler Tool and libraries available on Cloud platform using 28nm Technology. The Schmitt Trigger is a comparator circuit that incorporates positive feedback, are extensively used in digital as well as analog systems to filter out any noise present in a signal line and produce a clean digital signal. The working of design is verified using Circuit Schematic and Waveforms.
# Tool used
The Synopsys Custom Compilerâ„¢ design environment is a modern solution for full-custom analog, custom digital, and mixed-signal IC design. As the heart of the Synopsys Custom Design Platform, Custom Compiler provides design entry, simulation management and analysis, and custom layout editing features. It delivers industry-leading productivity, performance, and ease-of-use while remaining easy to adopt for users of legacy tools. The Custom Compiler design environment includes features for mixed-signal design entry, design debug, simulation management, analysis, and reporting.
